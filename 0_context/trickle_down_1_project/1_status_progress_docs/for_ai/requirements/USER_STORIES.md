# User Stories - Language Tracker Application

**Purpose**: This document provides comprehensive user stories for every feature, sub-feature, and requirement in the Language Tracker application. Each story includes specific user actions and expected outcomes to clarify how features should behave from the user's perspective.

**Organization**: Stories are organized by navigation hierarchy (Level 0-4) matching the actual application flow, making it easy to understand the user journey through the app.

**Testing & Automation Rule**: Every user story must document both (a) the automated flow(s) that validate it end-to-end and (b) the corresponding unit/integration tests (or TODO placeholders when coverage is pending). Keep these references current whenever the story changes.

5. User removes a syllable block if it is no longer needed
6. User confirms the multi-syllable configuration before saving the word

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Syllable blocks can be added, duplicated, reordered, and removed without refreshing the page
- Each syllable block displays onset/nucleus/coda pickers that stay scoped to the correct syllable
- Selected Word summary updates immediately to reflect syllable ordering and composition
- Validation prevents saving if required positions are empty (e.g., nucleus missing in a syllable)
- Saved word persists syllable order and per-position selections in the database
- Editing an existing word restores the same multi-syllable structure for further adjustments
- Automation coverage exercises at least one multi-syllable create/edit/delete path

**Test Coverage Expectations**:
- Add backend persistence tests that verify multi-syllable payloads round-trip through `/api/create-word` and `/api/update-word` (e.g., `tests/integration/test_words_multisyllable.py`).
- Extend UI-level tests to cover adding, reordering, and removing syllables, ensuring validation prevents incomplete syllables.

**Automation Flow Expectations**:
- Expand the words automation suite (new `scripts/mcp-words-multisyllable.mjs`) to create, edit, and delete multi-syllable words in both direct and realistic modes.
- Integrate the flow into the nightly story plan so regressions in syllable ordering are caught automatically.

### US-070: Preview Syllable Audio During Creation
**As a** language researcher refining pronunciation
**I want to** listen to each syllable and the full word while constructing it
**So that** I can confirm the sound sequence before saving

**User Actions**:
1. User selects phonemes for each syllable block inside the word creation interface (multi-syllable allowed)
2. User clicks the Selected Word panel to highlight the assembled word
3. User clicks the play icon on a syllable block to preview just that syllable
4. User clicks an individual phoneme block to hear that specific phoneme in context
5. User clicks the play icon on the Selected Word summary to hear the entire word
6. User repeats previews after changing phoneme selections or syllable order

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Selected Word panel visibly highlights the current word and exposes play controls for syllables, phoneme blocks, and whole-word playback
- Syllable play buttons call the TTS syllable-preview endpoint and stream audio without reloading the form
- Phoneme block clicks call the single-phoneme preview endpoint and return success/failure status inline
- Whole-word play button synthesizes the entire phoneme sequence using the `/api/tts/ipa` endpoint
- UI indicates loading/playing states and disables duplicate requests while audio is buffering
- Unsupported phonemes return actionable error messaging without breaking the form
- Playback works for both keyboard and pointer interactions and remains accessible (ARIA labels, focus states)
- Previews update immediately after any phoneme change or syllable reorder
- Errors are logged for diagnostics while the user receives clear guidance (e.g., ‚ÄúAzure TTS unavailable‚Äù)

**Test Coverage Expectations**:
- Unit tests around the TTS service to confirm syllable-scoped requests assemble the correct payload (`tests/unit/test_tts_syllable_preview.py`).
- Integration/UI tests that simulate preview button clicks and assert success/error messaging in the word builder.

**Automation Flow Expectations**:
- Extend automation to trigger syllable and whole-word previews during word creation, verifying audio status responses (update `scripts/mcp-words-multisyllable.mjs`).
- Record preview results in artifacts to track Azure availability during automated runs.

- Removing a video immediately hides the player and restores the upload CTA
- Permissions respect project ownership‚Äîonly editors see upload/replace actions while viewers can watch existing media
- Automation coverage confirms upload, playback, replacement, and removal flows for local and cloud projects

**Test Coverage Expectations**:
- Backend tests validating `/api/remove-video` and word detail API endpoints correctly manage storage references (`tests/integration/test_word_videos.py`).
- UI tests that confirm the detail page renders player controls, upload prompts, and error states across local/cloud storage.

**Automation Flow Expectations**:
- Add or extend automation (e.g., `scripts/mcp-word-media.mjs`) to upload, replace, play, and remove videos from the word detail view in both storage modes.

### US-068: Google Account Cloud Lifecycle Verification
**As a** QA engineer validating external identity flows  
**I want to** exercise real Google and email accounts through onboarding, project creation, and migration  
**So that** I confirm Auth0/Firebase sign-in, cloud sync, and Firestore persistence all work end-to-end

**User Actions**:
1. Ensure reusable test accounts exist:
   - Real Google account (e.g. `20251010junk20251010@gmail.com`)
   - Real email/password account for Auth0 email flow
2. Delete any lingering application data tied to those accounts (app users, projects, Firestore docs)
3. Launch the app in a clean session
4. Sign up with the real email/password account via Auth0
   - Verify confirmation email (if required) and first-time login UX
5. Sign out and sign back in with the email account to validate session persistence
6. Sign in with the real Google account using the ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù button (Auth0 hosted login)
   - Confirm OAuth consent, callback handling, and dashboard landing
7. Create a **local** project and add sample phonemes, templates, and words
   - Record the exact items added for later verification
8. Convert the local project to a **cloud** project:
   - Use ‚ÄúMigrate to Cloud‚Äù (or equivalent) button
   - Push at least one additional change after migration
9. Create a brand-new **cloud-first** project while still logged in with Google
   - Add phonemes, templates, and words directly to the cloud variant
10. Open Firestore (or use automation helpers) to verify:
    - Cloud project document exists (collection `projects`)
    - Words stored under `words` with matching content from the UI
    - Phonemes/templates stored under `phonemes` / `data/phoneme_templates` and reflect UI changes
11. Delete the Google-authenticated user and associated projects from the app UI
12. Clean up Firestore documents tied to the user (projects, words, phonemes)
13. Repeat steps 4‚Äì10 to ensure repeatability across runs
14. Repeat entire flow for the email/password account to ensure parity

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Auth0 Google Sign-In works with real accounts (popup/redirect) and lands on dashboard
- Auth0 email/password sign-up & login succeed with proper session handling
- Migrations copy all local data to the cloud variant (words, phonemes, templates)
- Cloud-first project writes create corresponding Firestore documents
- Firestore documents contain accurate fields (project, word, phoneme collections)
- Re-running with the same real accounts after cleanup behaves consistently
- Automated tooling can query Firestore (via REST/Admin) to assert presence of new documents
- Documentation updated with instructions for provisioning demo accounts and cleanup
- Automation scripts (MCP flows) cover both local/cloud creation and Firestore verification
