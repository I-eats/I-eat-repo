# Requirements Overview

This directory consolidates feature requirements sourced from stakeholder prompts and ongoing conversations. Each feature has a dedicated specification document that captures goals, functional expectations, acceptance criteria, and intended outcomes. Use this index to stay aligned on scope before starting implementation or test planning.

## App Purpose and Outcomes

### Mission
The Language Tracker provides language teams with a unified workspace for building and managing constructed-language content. The app pairs phoneme frequency tracking with collaborative project management so contributors can analyze sounds, create words, and share artifacts across local and cloud storage without friction.

### Product Goals
- **Empower rapid prototyping**: Enable linguists and educators to iterate on constructed languages quickly by centralizing data entry, phoneme analytics, and multimedia attachments
- **Reduce coordination overhead**: Give every feature an isolated workflow that minimizes conflicts while still supporting shared branching and cloud syncing across teams
- **Guarantee data integrity**: Validate both local SQLite data and remote Firebase assets through automated tests and structured deployment flows

### How Features Work Together
Each feature below contributes to the collaborative language-building ecosystem. Cloud integration ensures data portability, project controls enable team workflows, search and mobile UX remove friction from daily use, and isolation conventions keep development scalable. See [App Product Overview](app_product_overview.md) for deeper context on how these pieces fit together.

## Feature Requirements

Features are organized by **navigation hierarchy** to match how users experience the application. This structure mirrors the actual page flow from authentication through dashboard, projects, and into project-scoped work areas.

**Navigation Flow:**
```
Level 0: Login/Register
    ‚Üì
Level 1: Dashboard ‚Üí My Projects | My Groups
    ‚Üì
Level 2: My Projects (list, search, create, manage)
    ‚Üì
Level 3: Enter Project ‚Üí Variant Menu
    ‚Üì
Level 4: Phonemes | Words | Administration
```

**Testing & Automation Policy:** Every feature spec and user story in this directory must reference the automated flows and tests that exercise it. When new requirements are added, update the corresponding test suites and automation scripts (or capture explicit TODO placeholders) so the coverage ledger stays current.

## üóÇÔ∏è Level 2: My Projects (Project Management Layer)

Accessed from Dashboard ‚Üí My Projects (`/projects`). This level manages project creation, organization, searching, and cloud/local storage operations.

### Project-Level Controls and Branching ‚Äî [`project_branches_and_global_actions.md`](project_branches_and_global_actions.md)

**Purpose**: Support multi-variant collaboration through project grouping, branching, and merging similar to Git workflows, enabling teams to iterate on cloud or local copies in parallel.

**Navigation**: My Projects ‚Üí Project Actions (Edit/Branch/Merge/Share/Delete)

**All Requirements**:
1. **Store project-level title independent of variant names** ‚Üí **Result**: Project group has its own title; edit/delete/share actions apply to the group as a whole
2. **Provide project-level branch control** ‚Üí **Result**: Teams can initiate new variants from project level without drilling into branch cards; defaults to main variant when present
3. **Support branching from any variant (local or cloud)** ‚Üí **Result**: Users can create nested branches from any variant; each branch tracks its parent and appears as new variant under same project group
4. **Replace Project Menu with Variant Menu** ‚Üí **Result**: New Variant Menu lists group's variants and subprojects when user enters that group or subproject
5. **Initialize new branches with parent's variant copies** ‚Üí **Result**: Branching a project group initializes new subproject with copies of parent's variants for seamless work continuation
6. **Provide merge workflow for variant reconciliation** ‚Üí **Result**: Users can merge one branch's variant back into another (e.g., branch into main) with conflict-free copying
7. **Project-level delete removes all associated variants** ‚Üí **Result**: Deleting project removes all variants (local and cloud) and clears related shares
8. **Remove Cloud & Local Storage from Administration** ‚Üí **Result**: Legacy Administration entry removed; equivalent controls live on My Projects page

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Editing project group updates only aggregated title; variant names unchanged unless explicitly edited
- Project-level Branch button opens branching flow with default source preselected (main when available); new variant recorded under project group
- Entering project/subproject launches Variant Menu showing variants and child branches with clear affordances to enter specific variant
- Newly created branches inherit parent's variants and appear immediately in Variant Menu for new subproject
- Merge actions let users pick source/destination variant; on success, target data reflects source contents with UI confirmation
- Branch creation prompts for branch name, records parentage, and produces usable variant copy populated with source data
- Project-level share operations select appropriate variant (cloud preferred) and succeed for both local/cloud groups without identifier errors
- Administration screen no longer lists Cloud & Local Storage card

**See Full Spec**: [project_branches_and_global_actions.md](project_branches_and_global_actions.md)

---

### My Projects Search ‚Äî [`project_search_filtering.md`](project_search_filtering.md)

**Purpose**: Help users find project groups quickly as their workspace grows by providing instant client-side filtering.

**Navigation**: My Projects ‚Üí Search Box

**All Requirements**:
1. **Provide search control within My Projects page** ‚Üí **Result**: Search input filters visible project cards as user types
2. **Match project group names and sub-project names** ‚Üí **Result**: Search matches both group names and nested branch titles so related branches surface together
3. **Operate on client without page reload** ‚Üí **Result**: Search executes client-side and clears gracefully when query is removed

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Typing partial string narrows list to only cards containing that text in project or sub-project titles
- Clearing search field restores full project list in prior order
- When no items match, UI communicates "no results" instead of showing empty area
- Visual styling remains consistent with My Projects layout; no disruptive elements pushing controls off-screen on smaller viewports
- Design leaves room near search input for future expansion (filtering by storage type or variant counts)

**See Full Spec**: [project_search_filtering.md](project_search_filtering.md)

---

### Cloud Variant Controls Parity ‚Äî [`cloud_variant_actions.md`](cloud_variant_actions.md)

**Purpose**: Give cloud variants the same management capabilities as local variants inside the Projects UI, so owners can administer cloud projects without switching to local copies.

**Navigation**: My Projects ‚Üí Cloud Project Actions

**All Requirements**:
1. **Display Edit, Delete, and Share actions for cloud variants** ‚Üí **Result**: Cloud variant owners see Edit, Delete, and Share buttons in Projects interface
2. **Retain Fork to Local option for cloud variants** ‚Üí **Result**: Fork to Local remains available alongside existing local variant controls
3. **Enable Share flow with cloud project identifiers** ‚Üí **Result**: Share modal and API endpoints work with cloud project identifiers using same flow as local projects
4. **Handle both numeric (local) and string (cloud) IDs safely** ‚Üí **Result**: Project identifiers are encoded properly in modal operations for both ID types

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Owners see Edit, Delete, Share, and Fork to Local buttons when project's active variant is in cloud; non-owners see only permitted actions
- Editing a cloud project name persists changes in Firestore and updates language attribute for associated words
- Deleting a cloud project removes Firestore document, associated words/phonemes, and clears all `project_shares` entries
- Sharing/unsharing cloud projects via modal succeeds without identifier errors; dashboard's shared-projects list includes cloud projects with accurate metadata
- Identifier handling is consolidated in API layer for transparent operation with both local and cloud IDs

**Cross-References**:
- User Stories: [US-068](USER_STORIES.md#us-068-google-account-cloud-lifecycle-verification)
- Automation & Tests:
  - `scripts/mcp-cloud-projects.mjs` (cloud project lifecycle, Firestore check)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Production Deployment Checklist

The repository now ships with helpers and artifacts to streamline Firebase configuration. Complete these steps (in order) when promoting builds to staging or production:

1. **Provide environment variables for the Firebase Web SDK**  
   Set the following variables in your deployment environment (they override `config/firebase/firebase-config.js`):  
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`  
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`  
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`  
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`  
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`  
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`

2. **Define Firestore security rules**  
   - Review `config/firebase/firestore.rules` (included in this repo) and deploy it with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` to both dev and prod projects.

3. **Enable Google Sign-In**  
   - In Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in Method, enable Google provider and whitelist your app domains.  
   - If you proxy through Auth0, mirror the callback URLs there.

4. **(Optional) Configure Admin SDK access for automation**  
   - Supply a service account using either `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` (JSON string) or `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` (absolute path).  
   - Tests automatically fall back to the Admin SDK when Firestore rules block REST reads.

5. **Run automation smoke tests**  
   - Execute `scripts/mcp-google-auth.mjs`, `scripts/mcp-cloud-projects.mjs`, and `scripts/mcp-cloud-migration.mjs` against the deployed environment to verify authentication, migrations, and Firestore state.

After these steps, only console-side changes (rule publishing, provider toggles) remain for operators.

6. **Cloud project identifiers** ‚Üí String-based Firestore document IDs vs. numeric local SQLite IDs

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Cloud projects stored in Firestore collections (`projects`, `words`, `phonemes`)
- Media files uploaded to Firebase Storage with public URLs stored in Firestore documents
- Users can create projects in either local or cloud storage via project creation flow
- Existing local projects can migrate to cloud via `/projects/<id>/migrate-to-cloud`
- Cloud projects can be forked to local copies via `/projects/<id>/fork-to-local`
- All API endpoints handle both local (integer) and cloud (string) project identifiers
- Firebase credentials configured via environment variables (see deployment docs)

**Technical Notes**:
- Firebase Admin SDK used for server-side operations
- Firestore security rules enforce user-based access control
- Cloud integration gracefully degrades when Firebase unavailable
- Storage quotas and limits managed per Firebase project configuration

*Note: Cloud integration testing is documented in [cloud_integration_tests.md](cloud_integration_tests.md)*

## üéµ Cross-Cutting: Audio & Media Services

These features integrate throughout the application wherever phonemes and words are displayed or created.

### Text-to-Speech Integration ‚Äî [`tts_integration.md`](tts_integration.md)

**Purpose**: Provide audible pronunciation feedback for IPA phonemes and constructed words using text-to-speech technology, enabling users to hear how phonemes and words should sound during creation and study.

**Integration Points**: Word Creation, Phoneme Views, Word Display

**All Requirements**:
1. **Integrate Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK** ‚Üí **Result**: IPA phonemes convert to audio playback via Azure TTS
2. **Provide API endpoints for phoneme pronunciation** ‚Üí **Result**: Single phoneme and multi-phoneme word synthesis available via API
3. **Support pronounceability checking** ‚Üí **Result**: Users can check if individual phonemes are pronounceable before synthesis
4. **Return audio status with error messaging** ‚Üí **Result**: Clear success/failure/unsupported status returned for all TTS requests
5. **Handle Azure API unavailability gracefully** ‚Üí **Result**: Service returns informative status without crashing when Azure unavailable
6. **Minimize API calls through caching/streaming** ‚Üí **Result**: Audio cached or streamed to reduce latency and API costs
7. **Expose TTS status endpoint** ‚Üí **Result**: Status endpoint verifies Azure connectivity and service health

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Requesting `/api/tts/phoneme` with IPA symbol triggers Azure TTS and returns success/failure
- Requesting `/api/tts/ipa` with phoneme sequence synthesizes full word pronunciation
- API endpoint `/api/phonemes/check-single` validates phoneme TTS support
- TTS status endpoint (`/api/tts/status`) reports Azure Speech Services availability
- Unsupported/malformed phonemes return clear errors without blocking word creation
- Audio playback integrates into word creation and phoneme exploration interfaces
- Missing Azure credentials cause graceful degradation without affecting other features

### Video & Media Management ‚Äî [`media_management.md`](media_management.md)

**Purpose**: Enable multimedia enrichment of constructed language words by supporting video uploads, storage, playback, and deletion across both local file systems and Firebase Cloud Storage.

**Integration Points**: Word Creation, Word Editing, Word Display

**All Requirements**:
1. **Allow video file uploads** ‚Üí **Result**: Users can upload video files (MP4, WebM, etc.) and associate them with specific words
2. **Store videos in project-specific directories** ‚Üí **Result**: Uploaded videos stored in organized project-specific directory structure
3. **Provide video playback endpoint** ‚Üí **Result**: Dedicated serving endpoint handles both local and cloud video paths
4. **Support removing video attachments** ‚Üí **Result**: Users can remove video attachments while cleaning up underlying storage
5. **Integrate with Firebase Storage** ‚Üí **Result**: Cloud projects upload videos to Firebase Storage with URL tracking
6. **Handle uploads during and after creation** ‚Üí **Result**: Videos can be added during word creation or as post-creation attachments
7. **Track video file paths** ‚Üí **Result**: Word records store video paths for retrieval and deletion
8. **Manage storage quotas and limits** ‚Üí **Result**: File size limits and quota management prevent storage abuse

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Video upload during word creation saves to `videos/<project_id>/` and stores path in word record
- Endpoint `/videos/<filename>` serves videos with proper MIME types for browser playback
- Removing video via `/api/remove-video/<id>` deletes file and clears database reference
- Cloud projects upload videos to Firebase Storage and store cloud URL
- Local projects store videos on server file system with relative paths
- File names are sanitized using `secure_filename()` to prevent path traversal
- Failed uploads return clear errors (file too large, unsupported format, storage unavailable)
- Deleting word cascades to delete associated video file from storage

**See Full Spec**: [media_management.md](media_management.md)

## üß™ Cross-Cutting: Testing & Infrastructure

These features support development, testing, and maintaining code quality across the entire application.

### Cloud Integration Tests ‚Äî [`cloud_integration_tests.md`](cloud_integration_tests.md)

**Purpose**: Maintain confidence that Firestore and Firebase Storage workflows function end to end by exercising real cloud operations through automated integration tests.

**Scope**: Backend testing infrastructure

**All Requirements**:
1. **Provide automated tests for cloud project creation and word verification** ‚Üí **Result**: Tests create a cloud project with associated words and verify their presence in Google Firestore
2. **Validate media asset upload/download workflows** ‚Üí **Result**: Media assets (videos, pictures) tied to words can be uploaded to and retrieved from Firebase Storage
3. **Isolate test data with temporary identifiers and cleanup** ‚Üí **Result**: All integration data uses clearly-scoped temporary identifiers and is removed after test runs
4. **Skip tests safely when cloud services unavailable** ‚Üí **Result**: Test suite skips gracefully when Firebase services, credentials, or required SDKs are unavailable

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Running `RUN_FIREBASE_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 python3 -m unittest tests.integration.test_cloud_integration` executes Firestore and Storage tests that pass (or skip appropriately) without manual intervention
- Firestore test coverage confirms created words are retrievable via both project-scoped and direct document lookups
- Storage test coverage confirms uploaded assets can be fetched with matching content and blobs are removed during cleanup
- Test artifacts use `integration-tests` prefix and target development environment, never mutating production projects

**See Full Spec**: [cloud_integration_tests.md](cloud_integration_tests.md)

### Parallel Feature Isolation ‚Äî [`parallel_feature_isolation.md`](parallel_feature_isolation.md)

**Purpose**: Keep feature work isolated so multiple contributors (human or AI) can build in parallel without conflicts by establishing clear conventions for file and directory structure.

**Scope**: Development conventions and repository structure

**All Requirements**:
1. **Introduce feature-scoped directory structure** ‚Üí **Result**: Every feature has clearly named home (e.g., `features/<feature_name>/`) for its views, logic, and tests
2. **Confine edits to feature directories** ‚Üí **Result**: When implementing/updating a feature, edits stay within that feature's directory unless platform-wide changes explicitly required
3. **Provide guidance for cross-cutting updates** ‚Üí **Result**: Documentation explains how to stage shared changes (styles, components, data migrations) to minimize conflicts (e.g., staging utility refactors before feature work)
4. **Colocate automated tests with feature code** ‚Üí **Result**: Each feature directory includes automated tests executable independently
5. **Document naming and organization rules** ‚Üí **Result**: Codex instructions tell contributors to create or reuse feature-scoped directories before starting implementation

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Repository structure includes clear examples showing how to place feature code, assets, and tests together (e.g., `features/firebase/`, `features/projects/`)
- When future features are added, commits touch only relevant feature directories plus shared infrastructure where justified
- Running feature tests doesn't require touching unrelated modules because dependencies live in feature directory or shared utility layers
- Existing mixed-content directories are gradually split during next touch rather than through disruptive repo-wide refactor
- Conventions may be enforced with linting or CI checks once structure stabilizes

**See Full Spec**: [parallel_feature_isolation.md](parallel_feature_isolation.md)

**Implementation Guides**:
- **[Parallel Development Architecture](../PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete architectural design for parallel AI agent development, including folder structure, migration plan, and conflict avoidance strategies
- **[Development Conventions](../DEVELOPMENT_CONVENTIONS.md)** - Specific coding standards, naming conventions, and patterns for AI agents working in parallel

## Working Rule

Every time a new product prompt describes desired behavior, features, or requirements, capture it in a dedicated Markdown spec inside this directory and add (or update) the relevant entry in this index. Treat the spec and this overview as the single source of truth for requirement documentation.

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep the source prompt reference at the top of each requirement file so we can trace updates back to their originating request.
- Update acceptance criteria as code and tests evolve; if a feature gains automated coverage, link to the relevant test suite.
- Add new requirement files whenever fresh feature directives arrive, and remember to register them in the list above.
- When enhancing this overview, ensure all functional requirements and expected outcomes from individual specs are accurately reflected in the summaries above.
- **Navigation-based organization**: When adding new features, place them in the appropriate navigation level (0-4) or cross-cutting section based on where users access them in the application flow.
