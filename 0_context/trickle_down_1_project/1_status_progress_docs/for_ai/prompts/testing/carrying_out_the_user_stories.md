use the playwright mcp server to carry out all of the user stories in the docs/for_ai/requirements/USER_STORIES.md file. Make sure to read the user stories carefully and follow all instructions. After completing each user story, provide a brief summary of what was done and any relevant details. Ensure that all functionalities are tested thoroughly and report any issues encountered during the process. Be sure to test each one as if you were a user, using the chromium browser and the playwright mcp server to interact with the application. If there is an issue that causes you to be unable to complete a user story, document the issue clearly and suggest possible solutions or workarounds. Then carry out those solutions or workarounds as needed to complete the user stories. After fixing any issues, continue with the remaining user stories until all have been addressed.
