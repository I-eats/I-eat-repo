It seems that specifically, whenever I choose a word from the phoneme blocks within the syllable configuration section, the selected word section looks great, and the function where it will display the individual phoneme blocks and highlight the phoneme block that it is sounding out whenever you either double-click or shift-click or control-click or anything like that or right-click works great.

But, whenever I choose from one of the suggested words or word suggestions, it will - the selected word displayed at the top doesn't have the functionality that I want it to and is lacking that and just shows the word but not the individual word blocks nor the instructions on how you can double-click or so on and so forth in order to get individual sounds.
