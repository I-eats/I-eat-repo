Make it so that the flow in the UI for creating words shows at the top the selected word you have. Then the language. And then the English word you want to do. And then have it show the Syllable Configuration section, the Optimized Word Suggestions section, and the already existing English words if it finds any. Then, after the user picks word sounds, have them input the new language word spelling and upload a video if they should want to, and then they can click on the Create Word button. The layout should be going down vertically in that way, whenever the layout is on a mobile device or on a screen as large as a mobile device. So in other words, not on a desktop.
