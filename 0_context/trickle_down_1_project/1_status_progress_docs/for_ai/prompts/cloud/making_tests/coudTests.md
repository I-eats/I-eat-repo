Make it so that there are integration tests in place to make it so that we can test if the cloud functions are working. For example, if we make a project that is in the cloud and make words within that project, something that can check to see if when we create words in that project, it'll show up in the Google Firestore Claude databases. Also, cloud tests for storage like if we store a video or a picture that goes along with a word, if that will show up also in the storage of the firebase project.
