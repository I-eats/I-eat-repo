So it seems like many of the files of code that you are running, and many of the things that you need to run in code are using the same port. I'm not sure if that's best practice. Would it be true that for people that have run commands that cause them to run on the same port should use different ports? Or is it best practice to have them all run on the same port? Because I see that you have some background task stuff that's all running on the same port. For example, you have one background task that is running source.venv/bin/activate and port = 5001, which is running correctly, it seems. Except it has an error at the end. And you have another background task. Which is running in source/home/dos and code and so on and so forth. And it's error is in that port 5001 is being used by another program. And there are many other programs that are running in the background that you have running currently it seems. That are having this error. Do we need to fix this? Is this a problem? And if so what would be the best thing to do in order to fix it? It seems that all of them are running they have a runtime of many hours. Is that bad? Is that something to worry about? And how do we fix it? Is the best thing to do is to make it so they all run on different ports or is there a better solution that is more best practice?
