- **Issue:** `'onset_phoneme'` KeyError
- **Root Cause:** API expects different field structure
- **Impact:** Multi-syllable word creation API needs fixing
- **Tests:** Working correctly, revealing the issue

### Category 2: Auth Fixtures (8 tests)
- **Issue:** `get_user_info` not fully mocked
- **Root Cause:** Test fixtures need refinement
- **Impact:** Some tests get 302 redirects
