# Dashboard System - Project Level Specifications

## Project Overview
The I-Eat application will implement a comprehensive dashboard system with role-based interfaces for teachers and students. This project-level specification defines the overall system architecture, database design, and high-level implementation strategy.

## Project Scope
- **Role-based Authentication**: Teacher and student role selection during initial sign-up
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Class management, points distribution, and student oversight
- **Student Dashboard**: Personal points tracking, class information, and achievements
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization across all interfaces
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality across all device types

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 with Vite build system
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time + Storage)
- **Database**: Relational schema with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access control
- **Real-time**: WebSocket-based live updates

## Database Design
- `user_roles` - User role assignments and permissions
- `classes` - Class information and teacher assignments  
- `students` - Student enrollments and point balances
- `point_transactions` - Complete transaction history and audit trail

## Security Model
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- Role-based access control throughout the application
- Encrypted sensitive data and secure API endpoints
- Audit logging for all point transactions

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Foundation and role selection (Weeks 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Teacher dashboard implementation (Weeks 3-4)  
- **Phase 3**: Student dashboard implementation (Weeks 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features and real-time (Weeks 7-8)
- **Phase 5**: Testing, optimization, and deployment (Weeks 9-10)

## Success Metrics
- **Technical**: <2s page load, <500ms API response, 99.9% uptime
- **User Experience**: >90% teacher adoption, >80% student engagement
- **Business**: Daily active user growth, transaction volume tracking

## Documentation Structure

### Project Level (This Folder)
- **System Architecture**: Overall system design and technology stack

- **Project Timeline**: High-level implementation phases

### Feature Level (Trickle Down Level 2)
Detailed feature specifications are located in:
`/trickle_down_2_features/0_instruction_docs/dashboard_features/`

**Feature Categories:**
- **Authentication & Role Management**: User role selection and access control
- **Teacher Dashboard Features**: Class management, points distribution, student oversight
- **Student Dashboard Features**: Personal points, class info, achievements
- **Real-time Features**: Live updates and collaborative functionality

## Key Features Overview

### Teacher Dashboard
- **Class Management**: Display class information with teacher name and class code
- **Points System**: Total points display with quick action buttons (100, 50, 20 points)
- **Student List**: Comprehensive student management with avatars and names
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search to find specific students
- **Student Actions**: Give credit, reward, or penalty options per student
- **Analytics**: Class statistics and performance metrics

### Student Dashboard
- **Personal Points**: Current balance and points history
- **Class Information**: Class details and teacher information
- **Classmates**: List of other students in the class
- **Achievements**: Badges and milestone tracking
- **Activity Feed**: Recent transactions and class updates

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/signs in
2. Role selection screen (Teacher/Student)
3. Redirect to appropriate dashboard
4. Role-based access control throughout the application

- Class information display
- User experience optimization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Analytics and reporting features
- Mobile optimization and responsiveness
- Accessibility improvements

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Weeks 9-10)
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Bug fixes and performance optimization
- Security audit and hardening
- Documentation completion
