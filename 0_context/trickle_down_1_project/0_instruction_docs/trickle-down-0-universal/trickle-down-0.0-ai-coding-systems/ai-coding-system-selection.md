# AI Agent Coding System Selection
*Trickle-Down Level 0.0: AI Coding System Choice*

## Universal Requirement: Choose an AI Agent Coding System

**MANDATORY DECISION:** Every project using AI agents for development must choose a structured AI coding system.

## Available AI Agent Coding Systems

### 1. GitHub Spec Kit (Specification-Driven Development)
**Approach:** Specifications are executable and generate working implementations
- **Philosophy:** Code serves specifications (not the other way around)
- **Workflow:** `/speckit.constitution` → `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks` → `/speckit.implement`
- **Benefits:** Eliminates gap between intent and implementation
- **Best For:** Complex projects requiring detailed specifications

### 2. BMAD (Build, Measure, Analyze, Deploy)
**Approach:** Iterative development with measurement-driven decisions
- **Philosophy:** Data-driven development with continuous feedback loops
- **Workflow:** Build → Measure → Analyze → Deploy → Repeat
- **Benefits:** Evidence-based development decisions
- **Best For:** Projects requiring heavy analytics and optimization

### 3. Traditional AI-Assisted Development
**Approach:** AI agents assist with coding but follow traditional development patterns
- **Philosophy:** AI as coding assistant, traditional development methodologies
- **Workflow:** Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy
- **Benefits:** Familiar patterns with AI enhancement
- **Best For:** Teams comfortable with traditional methodologies

### 4. Agent-First Development (AFD)
**Approach:** AI agents are primary developers, humans guide and validate
- **Philosophy:** AI agents handle implementation, humans handle strategy
- **Workflow:** Strategic Direction → Agent Implementation → Human Validation → Iteration
- **Benefits:** Rapid development with human oversight
- **Best For:** Rapid prototyping and iteration-heavy projects

### 5. Collaborative Intelligence Development (CID)
**Approach:** Human-AI collaboration as equal partners
- **Philosophy:** Combine human creativity with AI consistency
- **Workflow:** Human Strategy ↔ AI Implementation ↔ Joint Validation
- **Benefits:** Leverages strengths of both humans and AI
- **Best For:** Complex problem-solving requiring both creativity and execution

## Selection Criteria

### Project Complexity
- **High Complexity:** Spec Kit, CID
- **Medium Complexity:** BMAD, AFD
- **Low Complexity:** Traditional AI-Assisted

### Team Experience
- **High AI Experience:** AFD, CID
- **Medium AI Experience:** Spec Kit, BMAD
- **Low AI Experience:** Traditional AI-Assisted

### Project Timeline
- **Long-term:** Spec Kit, BMAD
- **Medium-term:** CID, AFD
- **Short-term:** Traditional AI-Assisted, AFD

### Quality Requirements
- **Highest Quality:** Spec Kit, CID
- **High Quality:** BMAD, AFD
- **Standard Quality:** Traditional AI-Assisted

## Integration with Trickle-Down System

**Regardless of AI coding system chosen:**
- Must integrate with trickle-down documentation hierarchy
- Must follow TD0 → TD0.5 → TD1 → TD2 → TD3 context loading
- Must respect environment-specific requirements (TD0.5)
- Must align with project constitution (TD1)

## Implementation Requirements

**TD1 Project Level Must Specify:**
1. **Chosen AI coding system** and rationale
2. **Specific workflow steps** for the chosen system
3. **Integration approach** with trickle-down documentation
4. **Tool configurations** and setup requirements
5. **Team training** and onboarding procedures

## Decision Framework

**Step 1: Assess Project Needs**
- Complexity level
- Quality requirements
- Timeline constraints
- Team capabilities

**Step 2: Evaluate AI Coding Systems**
- Match system strengths to project needs
- Consider learning curve and setup time
- Evaluate tool ecosystem compatibility

**Step 3: Make Selection**
- Document choice in TD1 project constitution
- Justify selection based on project requirements
- Plan implementation and team onboarding

**Step 4: Configure Integration**
- Set up chosen system with trickle-down hierarchy
- Configure AI agents for selected workflow
- Establish quality gates and validation procedures

## Critical Success Factors

**Consistency:** All AI agents must use the same chosen system
**Integration:** System must work with existing project architecture
**Scalability:** System must support project growth and complexity
**Quality:** System must maintain or improve code quality standards
