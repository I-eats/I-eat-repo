## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install asyncio requests pyyaml dataclasses-json matplotlib networkx

# Run the setup demo
python features/meta-intelligent-orchestration/meta_intelligent_demo.py
```

### Firebase Instance

The system includes a **Firebase-specific instance** for Google Cloud and Firebase technologies:

```python
from features.meta_intelligent_orchestration.instances.firebase_config import FirebaseMetaIntelligentConfig, FirebaseProjectProfile, FirebaseProjectType

# Initialize Firebase configuration
config = FirebaseMetaIntelligentConfig()

# Get Firebase recommendations for a web app
profile = FirebaseProjectProfile(
    project_type=FirebaseProjectType.WEB_APP,
    user_count="medium",
    security_level="standard",
    budget_range="medium"
)

recommendations = config.get_firebase_recommendations(profile)
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from features.meta_intelligent_orchestration import MetaRecommendationEngine, ProjectScenario

# Initialize the meta-recommendation engine
engine = MetaRecommendationEngine()

# Get setup recommendations for a startup MVP
recommendations = engine.get_recommendation_for_scenario(ProjectScenario.STARTUP_MVP)

print(f"Development Environment: {recommendations.recommendations['development_environment'].recommendation}")
print(f"Confidence: {recommendations.overall_confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Future-Proof Score: {recommendations.future_proof_score:.2f}")
```

### Advanced Setup Configuration

```python
# Custom setup requirements
setup_requirements = {
    "project_type": "web_application",
    "development_stage": "mvp",
    "complexity": "high",
    "team_size": 5,
    "timeline": "flexible",
    "budget": "medium",
    "scalability_needs": "high",
    "security_requirements": "high",
    "ai_requirements": "advanced",
    "automation_level": "very_high"
}

# Get comprehensive setup recommendations
recommendations = engine.get_meta_recommendations(
    ProjectScenario.ENTERPRISE_APPLICATION, 
    setup_requirements
)

# Access specific setup recommendations
for rec_type, rec in recommendations.recommendations.items():
    print(f"{rec_type.value}: {rec.recommendation}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {rec.confidence.value}")
    print(f"  Future-Proof: {rec.future_proof_score:.2f}")
```
