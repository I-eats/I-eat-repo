# Initialize the master orchestrator
orchestrator = FirebaseMasterOrchestrator()

# Plan system architecture
goals = ["high_availability", "security_compliance", "cost_optimization"]
constraints = ["budget_limit", "security_requirements"]
architecture_plan = await orchestrator.plan_system_architecture(goals, constraints)

# Implement the system
success = await orchestrator.implement_system_architecture(architecture_plan)

# Manage ongoing operations
management_report = await orchestrator.manage_system()

# Generate comprehensive reports
report_file = orchestrator.generate_comprehensive_system_report()
```
