# New Word Creation Features

## Overview

The Add New Word feature has been enhanced with three different methods for creating words, each offering different approaches to phoneme selection and frequency management.

## Feature 1: Traditional Method (Original)

**What it does:** Updates phoneme frequencies immediately as each phoneme is selected.

**How it works:**
1. User selects syllable type (CVC or CV)
2. For each position (onset, nucleus, coda), user selects phoneme from hierarchical view
3. Phoneme frequency is updated immediately upon selection
4. Word is saved to database with structured phoneme data

**Use case:** When you want immediate feedback on phoneme usage and don't need to review before committing.

## Feature 2: Enhanced Method (New)

**What it does:** Delays frequency updates until the entire word is completed and confirmed.

**How it works:**
1. User selects syllable type (CVC or CV)
2. For each position, user selects phoneme (frequencies NOT updated yet)
3. User enters remaining word information
4. **Word summary is displayed for review**
5. User confirms before saving
6. **Only after confirmation, all phoneme frequencies are updated at once**

**Use case:** When you want to review your word choices before committing to frequency changes, or when you might want to cancel the process.

## Feature 3: Table-Based Method (New)

**What it does:** Shows onset, nucleus, and coda phoneme tables side by side for easier comparison.

**How it works:**
1. User selects syllable type (CVC or CV)
2. **User chooses length type:**
   - Option 1: Solo phonemes (single consonants, monophthongs)
   - Option 2: Multiple types (consonant clusters, diphthongs)
3. **Tables are displayed side by side showing:**
   - Onset phonemes (left)
   - Nucleus phonemes (middle) 
   - Coda phonemes (right, if CVC)
4. Each table shows phonemes with their current frequencies
5. User selects phonemes from the tables
6. Word summary is displayed for review
7. User confirms before saving and updating frequencies

**Use case:** When you want to see all available options at once and compare phonemes across positions visually.

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Delayed Frequency Updates**
- Traditional method: Updates frequencies immediately
- Enhanced & Table-based methods: Update frequencies only after completion
- Prevents partial frequency updates if user cancels mid-process

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- Word summary before committing
- Option to cancel before affecting phoneme statistics
- Clear confirmation process

### 3. **Visual Phoneme Selection**
- Table-based method shows all options at once
- Easier comparison between onset, nucleus, and coda
- Length type filtering for focused selection

### 4. **Consistent Data Structure**
- All methods save structured phoneme data
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Supports both immediate and delayed frequency updates

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added:
- `create_word_traditional()` - Original method with immediate updates
- `create_word_enhanced()` - New method with delayed updates
- `create_word_table_based()` - New method with side-by-side tables
- `select_phoneme_for_position_without_frequency_update()` - Selection without updates
- `update_phoneme_frequency()` - Batch frequency updates
- `display_phoneme_tables_side_by_side()` - Table display logic
- `select_phoneme_from_table()` - Selection from table view

### Database Schema:
All methods use the existing structured schema:
- `syllable_type` - CV or CVC
- `onset_phoneme` - Selected onset phoneme
- `onset_length_type` - Length type of onset
- `nucleus_phoneme` - Selected nucleus phoneme  
- `nucleus_length_type` - Length type of nucleus
- `coda_phoneme` - Selected coda phoneme (if CVC)
- `coda_length_type` - Length type of coda (if CVC)

## Usage Examples

### Starting Word Creation:
```
--- Word Creation Methods ---
1. Traditional method (updates frequencies immediately)
2. Enhanced method (updates frequencies after completion)
3. Table-based method (shows phoneme tables side by side)
```

### Length Type Selection (Table-based method):
```
Length type options:
1: Solo phonemes (single consonants, monophthongs)
2: Multiple types (consonant clusters, diphthongs)
```

### Word Summary (Enhanced & Table-based methods):
```
--- Word Summary ---
Language: MyLanguage
English: hello, hi
New Language: salama
IPA: salama
Dictionary: sa-la-ma
Syllable Type: CVC
Onset: s (single_consonants)
Nucleus: a (monophthongs)
Coda: m (single_consonants)

Save this word and update phoneme frequencies? (y/n):
```

## Migration Notes

- **Existing words:** Continue to work as before
- **New words:** Automatically use structured phoneme data
- **Database:** No changes required, existing schema supports all features
- **Backward compatibility:** All existing functionality preserved

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:
- ✓ All required functions exist
- ✓ Database schema supports new features  
- ✓ Phoneme data is available for all methods
- ✓ No syntax errors in the codebase

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Custom length type combinations
- Phoneme frequency preview before selection
- Batch word creation
- Phoneme usage statistics and recommendations
- Export/import of word creation templates
