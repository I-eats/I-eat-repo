- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### üé≠ Scenario-Specific Recommendations
- **Startup MVP**: Fast development, cost-effective, rapid iteration
- **Enterprise Application**: Scalable, secure, maintainable, compliant
- **Open Source Project**: Community-friendly, well-documented, accessible
- **B2B SaaS**: High performance, enterprise features, integration-ready
- **Custom Scenarios**: Tailored recommendations for unique requirements

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install asyncio requests pyyaml dataclasses-json matplotlib networkx

# Run the demo
python features/meta-intelligent-orchestration/meta_intelligent_demo.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from features.meta_intelligent_orchestration import MetaRecommendationEngine, ProjectScenario

# Initialize the meta-recommendation engine
engine = MetaRecommendationEngine()

# Get recommendations for a startup MVP
recommendations = engine.get_recommendation_for_scenario(ProjectScenario.STARTUP_MVP)

print(f"Technology Stack: {recommendations.recommendations['technology_stack'].recommendation}")
print(f"Confidence: {recommendations.overall_confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Future-Proof Score: {recommendations.future_proof_score:.2f}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Custom project requirements
project_requirements = {
    "project_type": "web_application",
    "development_stage": "mvp",
    "complexity": "high",
    "team_size": 5,
    "timeline": "flexible",
    "budget": "medium",
    "scalability_needs": "high",
    "security_requirements": "high",
    "ai_requirements": "advanced",
    "automation_level": "very_high"
}

# Get comprehensive meta-recommendations
recommendations = engine.get_meta_recommendations(
    ProjectScenario.ENTERPRISE_APPLICATION, 
    project_requirements
)

# Access specific recommendations
for rec_type, rec in recommendations.recommendations.items():
    print(f"{rec_type.value}: {rec.recommendation}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {rec.confidence.value}")
    print(f"  Future-Proof: {rec.future_proof_score:.2f}")
```

## Configuration

### Data Sources

The system monitors multiple data sources in real-time:

- **GitHub**: Repository trends, stars, forks, issues
- **Stack Overflow**: Tag popularity, survey data
- **NPM**: Package downloads and version statistics
- **PyPI**: Python package downloads and trends
