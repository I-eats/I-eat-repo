**003_create_students.sql**
- Links students to classes and tracks point balances
- Includes RLS policies for data isolation
- Creates indexes for performance

**004_create_point_transactions.sql**
- Tracks all point transactions with full history
- Includes RLS policies for secure access
- Creates indexes for efficient querying

**005_create_give_points_function.sql**
- Validates permissions and available points
- Updates student and class balances atomically
- Returns transaction results as JSON

### Development Migrations

**20251025085349_add_sample_data.sql**
- Adds sample classes, students, and transactions
- Useful for development and testing
- Includes realistic data for the dashboard

**20251025085559_update_user_roles_policies.sql**
- Improves user_roles table policies

- Prevents accidental role deletion

## üöÄ Running Migrations

### Current Status
‚úÖ **All core migrations have been applied** - Your database is fully functional!

### For Future Changes

**Method 1: Supabase SQL Editor (Current)**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the migration file content
4. Run the SQL to apply the migration

**Method 2: Supabase CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Login to Supabase
npx supabase login

# Link to your project
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Apply migrations
npx supabase db push
```

### üßπ Cleaning Up SQL Editor

Since we now have proper migration files, you can:

1. **Delete the saved queries** in the Supabase SQL Editor sidebar
2. **Keep the SQL Editor clean** for future ad-hoc queries
3. **Use migration files** as the source of truth for schema changes

**Queries to remove from SQL Editor:**
- "User roles (RBAC)"
- "Classes table with row-level access controls" 
- "Students and Classes with Row-Level Security"
- "Classes table with teacher ownership and RLS"
- "Students table with row-level security"
- "Point Transactions with Row-Level Security"

## Database Schema Overview

```
auth.users (Supabase Auth)
    ‚Üì
user_roles (1:1)
    ‚Üì
classes (1:many) ‚Üê teacher_id
    ‚Üì
students (many:many) ‚Üê class_id + user_id
    ‚Üì
point_transactions (1:many) ‚Üê student_id + teacher_id
```

## Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **Role-based access control** throughout the application
- **Data isolation** between different classes and users
- **Audit trail** for all point transactions
- **Atomic transactions** for point distribution

## Next Steps

After running the migrations:
1. Set up your Supabase environment variables
2. Test the authentication flow
3. Create test data for development
4. Implement real-time subscriptions
5. Add additional features as needed
