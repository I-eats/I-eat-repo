# SQL Editor Cleanup Guide

## 🧹 How to Clean Up Supabase SQL Editor

Since we now have proper migration files in `/website/supabase/migrations/`, you can safely remove the temporary queries from the Supabase SQL Editor.

### Steps to Clean Up

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Delete Saved Queries**
   In the left sidebar under "PRIVATE", delete these saved queries:
   - ❌ "User roles (RBAC)"
   - ❌ "Classes table with row-level access controls"
   - ❌ "Students and Classes with Row-Level Security"
   - ❌ "Classes table with teacher ownership and RLS"
   - ❌ "Students table with row-level security"
   - ❌ "Point Transactions with Row-Level Security"

3. **Keep the SQL Editor Clean**
   - Use it only for ad-hoc queries and testing
   - All schema changes should go through migration files

### ✅ What to Keep

- **Migration files** in `/website/supabase/migrations/` (these are your source of truth)
- **Working database** (all tables are created and functional)
- **Clean SQL Editor** for future development

### 🚀 Future Workflow

**For new database changes:**
1. Create migration: `npx supabase migration new feature_name`
2. Edit the migration file in `/website/supabase/migrations/`
3. Apply manually in SQL Editor (or use CLI when linked)
4. Commit migration file to git

**For quick testing:**
- Use the SQL Editor for one-off queries
- Don't save temporary queries as permanent ones

## 📁 Migration Files Status

All core migrations are applied and working:
- ✅ `001_create_user_roles.sql` - User roles table

Your database is fully functional and ready for development! 🎉
